#Yelpme so I don't have to.


##What
Yelpme uses the [yelp2](https://github.com/rdeshpande/yelp2) Ruby wrapper by [rdeshpande](https://github.com/rdeshpande)
to be used on the command line.

##Why
I'm lazy and often can't decide what to eat for lunch, dinner, breakfast,
bars, etc. Or I don't know what kind of pizza I want, but I know where.

Yes, I know I know.. I could go to Yelp's site and type this in, but
fuck that. As I said I'm lazy

##Who
You, and me baby.

I'd love pull requests, issues filed for new feature request, moar tests,
etc!


##Me :heart:
I'm [brntbeer](https://github.com/brntbeer) and I approve this message
